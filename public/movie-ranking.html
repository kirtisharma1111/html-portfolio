<h1>The Best Movies According to Kirti</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>50 Shades of Grey</h3>
 <p>This is my most favourite movie because this involves a lot of my fantasies and also the lead hero is very handsome , my perfect type. And 
    he do change from fuck boy type to romantic love boy type for his love, Anna and love based movies do attract me , fantacise me and I adore them.

 <h3>Romeo Juliet</h3>
 <p>THis is my second favourite movie because it involves the perfct blend of enemies in love and this Shakespeare's play contains a lot of beautiful
    love rhymes and the most famous quote "What's in a name". In this movie, they both love each other and die for each other and I always dreamt of
    this kind of love, romance and dedication and I believe that I will get such kind of love from my husband and I manifest it right now!
 </p>
 <h3>Mohabbatein</h3>
 <p>This is also one of my favourite movie. It contains very beautiful songs which I never get bored or tired of listening and also it based on
    the concept of love that's why I still like the movie even after watching numerous times and I will watch this along with my husband too
whoever he will  be and I manifest it too. I wish he loves me the way I always craved for.  </p>
