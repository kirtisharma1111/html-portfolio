<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself Kirti Sharma and I am 21 years old. I am doing engineering in Electronics and communication Engineering with specialization in 
  Artificial Intelligence from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, Rohini, Delhi. I will be graduated in 2026. I am also learing web 
  development from Udemy and MERN stack from Coding Ninjas. I am also learning Java from Coding Ninjas and PW skills and do practise 
  DSA questions along with that.

<p>My hobbies include listening music and watching romcoms. Other than music, I do have keen interest in astrology and occult science. I do watch 
  tarot card readings and I believe in it as I found most of them relatable and true for me.
